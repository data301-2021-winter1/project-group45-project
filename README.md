## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Ronan:
I'm interested in this dataset because it gives me an insight into the analytics of crowdsourcing. I want to research which aspects of this dataset can best determine a Kickstarter project's chances of success. For instance, I can look into how the goal amount affects project success as well as how other data such as the fundraising time-window and category type impact success. I think this dataset is a great choice for the dashboard we'll be making near the end of the project because it consists of hundreds of thousands of rows of data that can be used to accurately calculate things such as the average pledge per person, which can further contribute to measuring project success and can be visualized well in a dashboard.

Jenny:
Dataset is interesting to me as it contains large set of information about crowd preference towards different Kickstarter projects. I will research on the how the corwdsourcing can help planners of Kickstarters to set adequate goals for different types of prrojects to help maintain the balance of fundraising and success rate. To be more specific, I will look into the goals for different type and relate them to the success rate to come out with distributions for success fundrasing amount in different range. It is an interesting database as it is over a long time range and will reflect people's taste over time. It will also further researches on public feelings for such kind of projects.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We selected "Kickstarter Projects" as our dataset. Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding platform that gives people the chance to fund their innovations / creative projects. By presenting your ideas (often in video-form) people will come across your project and can choose to pledge some money if they're interested. People are more likely to support projects that have a "reward system" so if they pledge a certain amount then they can get something in return. If the project fails to reach its goal amount before the deadline then every supporter of the project gets their money back. This data is provided directly from Kickstarter, but Mickaël Mouillé compiled and uploaded the data to Kaggle for better accessibility. The dataset contains the kickstarter id, name, category, currency, launch date, deadline, goal amount, number of supporters, amount pledged, and whether the project was successful in reaching its goal or not. The data for this dataset was collected on February 8 2018, which puts most of the project dates in the range between 2009 and 2018.
